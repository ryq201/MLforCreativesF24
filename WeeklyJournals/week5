## Week 5
Something that stuck with me and I found myself questioning was when Fiebrink stated that ML and creative practices do not have to revolve around making money. It made me contemplate what the purpose of making art was, and as someone who has pondered about the practicality of an fine arts degree, made me wonder what I actually hoped to get from being at IMA. While I do not think I can really give a solid answer to this question at the moment, I do feel like I want to use ML to do something that would not be practical or impossible without it. 

A general plan of something I would like to create is something that can use the ML models we had in class to my advantage, such as optimizing identification of motion or objects. I want to experiment with some form of creation, where the user is involved. This could be something similar to the body painter I made from a few weeks back, but utilizing some of the newer models we learned such as the face mask, and having more functions for drawing and creation.
